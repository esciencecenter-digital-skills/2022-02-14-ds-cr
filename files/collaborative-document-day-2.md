## üß† Collaborative Notes

### Exercise: Working as a project collaborator (in breakout rooms)

- Log into Github and create a new repository
- Make the repository public
- clone it to your desktop
- add some code
- push the changes to the repository
- Add one person as a collaborator (settings -> Manage Access). Make sure everyone in the group has a collaborator.
- Create an issue in the repo where you are a collaborator
- Clone that repo
- make changes on a new branch
- push the changes
- submit a Pull Request
- wait for approval
- At the same time review a collaborators Pull Request
- (Optionally) Learn about [protecting branches](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches) and try it out.


### Exercise: Working as an external contributor (in breakout rooms)
- Remove your group member(s) as collaborators from your repository
- Fork another group members repo (Repository page, top right corner)
- Create an issue on the original repository
- Clone your forked repo to your computer
- Make some changes, use a somewhat real-world example so it makes sense to review it (but don't overdo it).
- Push it to your fork
- Make a change and commit it to the main branch
- push the changes
- make a pull request from your fork to the main repository mentioning the issue
- Consider turning your Pull Request into a draft Pull Request.
- let your code be reviewed by tagging the repo owner using (@Username)
- At the same time review Pull Request using comments on individual lines. Try to act as if it was a real peer review as much as possible.
- Accept or reject the Pull Request
- (Optionally) learn about [merge conflicts](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts) and try it out in your collaboration.


## Feedback

### Tips
- Give the tutorial based on command line, so it better aligns with day one.
- It took some time to form the groups within the breakouts, could be useful to give a way to do it (e.g. the pairs)
- Agree with what's said above: shw also command line based instructions instead of on github only
- A git cheat-sheet could be useful.  (+3)[There is one I found here](https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
- We had hard merge conflicts and could not solve it in the time for the excersice. Maybe some more time with it or go over merge conflicts that cannot be solved on github would be nice
- The first exersice (being collaborators), it was difficult to communicate as we were with 4 and thus 2 groups talking over each other (+1)
- Maybe make the 'contribute to your favorite (python) package' homework exercise mandatory in some small way (do anything: open an issue, fork a project or do a full pull request). IMO very fun and easy way to get into open-source collaboration. (+1)
- Some of the steps I saw for the first time, so took a bit longer to figure out by myself. Maby some detail can be added to the steps in the collaborative doc
- Either command line or browser, but both at the same time is confusing
- Show where to get the ssh or https link and which one to use
- I don't know to what extend we use collaboration but we can maybe create a reall program that does smth instead of a+b. That could yield more problems to solve.
- the SSH issues that occured were mostly due to windows and/or first time ssh/git users.
    - If windows users worked with WSL that would be easier to solve.
    - maybe as part of the course provide a repo with a simple script to create a ssh key which they download as part of the setup (the script), so people can quickly execute it if they get stuck.

### Tops
- The help during the breakout sessions was very nice
- Nice pace and excercises, not to complex but we got to do interesting things that I'll use int he future.
- Liked learning collaboration in the groups a lot, especially working in forks works well in smaller groups of 4
- The github collaboration features are new to me and very useful to know
- Felt like we went into more detail than on the 1st day.
- More interactive.
- Nice to hear how others solve issues/inconveniences.
- Good amount of excersices and theory
- Good balance and timing of breaks (+1)
- Good pace and break spacing, lot's of help during the session and breaks; exercises well constructed to understand the principles and learn the steps of the diferent processes
- The pre-workshop set-up instructions were very useful and was sufficient to do all the excercises
- Lots of helpers to assist
- Nice to be able to practice collaboration in a small group
- Very good to do all the exercises ourself as well, realized where I misunderstood or make mistakes
